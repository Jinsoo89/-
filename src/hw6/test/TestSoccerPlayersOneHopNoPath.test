# Find a path with only one "hop" (edge) using the full SoccerPlayers data set.
# This test exercises both the parser and BFS algorithm on a simple
# graph, so it is more of a system test than a true unit test.

# To run this test, you will need to have downloaded the soccerPlayers dataset and
# place it in src/hw6/data/soccerPlayers.tsv.
