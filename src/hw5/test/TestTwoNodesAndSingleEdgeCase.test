# Sample testing file.
# Tests that a graph can be created, a single node and
# an edge that connects to the node itself, and a single node
# and a single edge can be printed out.

# Create a graph
CreateGraph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
AddNode graph1 n1
AddNode graph1 n2

# Add an edge
AddEdge graph1 n1 n2 edge1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
ListNodes graph1
ListChildren graph1 n1
