# Sample testing file.
# Tests that a graph can be created, two nodes and
# two edges that connects each other, and nodes
# and edges can be printed out.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge edge1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge edge2 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(edge1)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(edge2)
