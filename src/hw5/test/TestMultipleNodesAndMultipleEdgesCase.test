# Sample testing file.
# Tests that a graph can be created, multiple nodes and
# multiple edges. And nodes and edges can be printed out.

# Create a graph
CreateGraph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
AddNode graph1 n1
AddNode graph1 n2
AddNode graph1 n3

# Add an edge
AddEdge graph1 n1 n2 edge1
AddEdge graph1 n2 n3 edge2
AddEdge graph1 n3 n1 edge3
AddEdge graph1 n3 n2 edge4
AddEdge graph1 n3 n3 edge5

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
ListNodes graph1
ListChildren graph1 n1
ListChildren graph1 n2
ListChildren graph1 n3
