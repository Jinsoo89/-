# Sample testing file.
# Tests that a graph can be created, a single node and
# an edge that connects to the node itself, and a single node
# and a single edge can be printed out.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge edge1 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(edge1)
