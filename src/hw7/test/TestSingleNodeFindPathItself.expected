# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when there is a possible path

# Create graph players, which has a single node
created graph players
added node C.Ronaldo to players
added edge 0.000 from C.Ronaldo to C.Ronaldo in players 

# Find path between the single node and itself
path from C.Ronaldo to C.Ronaldo:
total cost: 0.000
